Intelligently Monitor SQL Server Agent

SQL Server provides limited monitoring capabilities for SQL Agent jobs in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 
You have the Job Activity Monitor and View History for a job, while these items provide useful information, you need more.

In this webinar, learn how to use and query the system tables in the msdb database to retrieve the data you need to 
support your own customized SQL Agent monitoring solution.

In this session I will demonstrate:

+ Calculating average job step and job duration based on job history
+ Sending notifications for jobs that are running longer than normal
+ Predicting when a currently running job step and job will complete based on job history
+ Using a Power BI report to view this information on demand and more.
